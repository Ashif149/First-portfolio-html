<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I was born in Queens, New York, to parents who immigrated from a small country called Bangladesh. Growing up in a vibrant and diverse community, I was surrounded by a mix of cultures and traditions, which shaped my understanding of the world. My parents worked hard to provide a better life for our family, and their dedication instilled in me a strong work ethic and a desire to achieve my goals..</p>

<p>Driven by a commitment to financial literacy and a desire to take care of my family, I pursued higher education with determination. I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Business Management, followed by a Master’s degree in Finance. As the first in my family to graduate from college, these accomplishments hold special significance, symbolizing both personal achievement and the fulfillment of my parents' dreams. My education has equipped me with the skills and knowledge to navigate the financial world, ensuring that I can provide stability and support to my loved ones.</p>

<p>Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I find joy in activities that keep me active and engaged. Basketball is a passion of mine, offering both physical exercise and a sense of community. I also enjoy working out regularly, which helps me maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle. In my downtime, I relax by playing video games, a hobby that allows me to unwind and explore new worlds. These interests provide a well-rounded balance to my life, keeping me focused and energized.</p>
